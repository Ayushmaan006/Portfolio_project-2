# Data Cleaning and Exploring

Data Cleaning and Exploration of the COVID-19 Dataset
Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring a dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of my journey into data analytics, this is my first unguided project where I apply the fundamental skills I've learned in data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis.

The aim is to take raw COVID-19 data and transform it into a structured format suitable for analysis, followed by key insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

Objectives
-Clean and preprocess the raw dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Visualize key insights using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Primary programming language used in the project.
Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: This is for visualizing trends and insights.
Jupyter Notebook: To write and run the project code interactively.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and other variables over time. It includes the following fields (this will depend on your dataset):

Date
Country/Region
Confirmed Cases
Deaths
Recovered Cases
Active Cases
